Steps : we instantiate the paginator class with the number of objects we want to display in each page
we get the page GET parameter that indicates the current page number
we obtain the objcts for the desired page by calling the page() method of the paginator.
if the page parameter is not an integer, we retrieve the first page of the results, if this parameter is a number greater than the last page of results, we retrieve the last page
we pass the page number and retrieved objects to the template

Notes on using the form - we use the same view to display the intial form and process the submitted data. we differentiate the form was submitted or not based on the request method. we are going to submit the form usng the post method. we assume that if we get the get request, an empt form has to be diplayed, and if we get a post request, the form has been submitted and needs to be processed.
